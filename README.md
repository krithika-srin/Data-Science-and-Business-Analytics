# Data-Science-and-Business-Analytics

This repository contains code for all exercised I've attempted and the projects in my Data Science and Business Analytics course. <br>
The .ipynb files are Jupyter notebook files that contain code. <br>
The .pdf and .pptx files are project presentation files- these summarize answers to certain questions and key findings of the project. <br>
