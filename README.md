# Data-Science-and-Business-Analytics

This repository contains code for all exercised I've attempted and the projects in my Data Science and Business Analytics course.
The .ipynb files are Jupyter notebook files that contain code.
The .pdf and .pptx files are project presentation files- these summarize answers to certain questions and key findings of the project.
